# Bookshelf-App
This repository contains the Bookshelf App project, developed as part of the Dicoding program. Built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to add, organize, and manage books across two shelves (“Belum Selesai Dibaca” and “Selesai Dibaca”) with localStorage for data persistence.
